I'm currently a MD-PhD student at Harvard, in the PhD program in health policy and economics.

Recently, I've been thinking a lot about the intersections of economics and human biology - using economic tools to test hypotheses from physiology and medicine, and trying to understand the economic consequences of health. I’m particularly interested in global contexts and older populations, and measuring health insofar as it is important to address these questions.

Prior to grad school, I was an undergraduate in the Robertson Scholars program at Duke, where I studied economics and chemistry, and spent a year as an NBER research assistant.

If you have any shared interests, feel free to shoot me an email!
