I'm currently a [MD-PhD student](https://www.hms.harvard.edu/md_phd/index.html) in health policy and economics at Harvard, and a graduate affiliate of the [Center for Population and Development Studies](https://popcenter.harvard.edu).

Recently, I've been thinking a lot about the intersections of economics and human biology - using economic tools to test hypotheses from physiology and medicine, and understanding the fundamental causes and consequences of health changes. Iâ€™m particularly interested in global contexts and older populations, and measuring health insofar as it is important to address these questions. 

Prior to grad school, I was an undergraduate in the [Robertson Scholars](https://robertsonscholars.org) program at Duke, and spent a year as a research assistant at Duke/NBER.

If you have any shared interests, feel free to get in touch!
