I'm currently a MD-PhD student at Harvard, in the PhD program in health policy and economics.

Recently, I've been thinking a lot about the intersections of economics and human biology - using economic tools to test hypotheses from physiology and medicine, working to understand how health is produced, as well as trying to understand the economic consequences of health changes. Iâ€™m particularly interested in global contexts and older populations, and measuring health insofar as it is important to address these questions. 

Prior to grad school, I was an undergraduate in the Robertson Scholars program at Duke, and spent a year as an NBER research assistant.

If you have any shared interests, feel free to get in touch!
